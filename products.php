          Scheduled for release in Q4 2016, The March is an action-strategy game about social justice movements built on Mihrtec's Strapp
          technology to allow anonymous multiplayer through the web.  The March pits players against a tyrannical Patriarchy in a competition
          of both power and public opinion.  As authority starts to crack down and popular opinion shifts, can the movement sustain enough
          momentum to achieve total reformation?  Players create and manage their own social movements, and take on the role of a movement
          leader who moves about the city commanding large numbers of civilian followers to subvert, coerce, and ultimately defeat the Patriarchy.

          Busted Metal is a tabletop game of friendly tactical and strategic competition between two or more players. Combining elements of
          traditional tabletop wargames, pen-and-paper roleplaying games, and popular computer games, Busted Metal is both an appeal to nostalgia
          and a fresh take on well-established genre tropes. Set in an alternate Earth-like timeline both familiar and bizarre, each player controls
          a gang of demented techno-barbarians, pawns in a violent struggle for control of the streets and blocks of a shattered cityscape. Over-the-top,
          action-movie fun, satisfying depth to decision making, and a sense of reward rooted in merit are what you should expect when playing Busted Metal.
